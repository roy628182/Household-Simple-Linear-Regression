# Household-Simple-Linear-Regression
This repository contains a simple linear regression analysis of household data, examining the relationship between various features and expenses.

Key Features

- Simple linear regression modeling
- Household feature analysis (income, family size, location)
- Expense prediction
- Data visualization (scatter plots, residual plots)
- Model evaluation (R-squared, mean squared error)

Future Work

- Incorporate additional features (e.g., location, housing type)
- Develop multiple linear regression models
- Expand dataset to include more diverse populations

Also, consider adding sections like:

- Data Dictionary: Describe the variables and features in the dataset.
- Model Evaluation: Provide detailed evaluation metrics for the model.
- References: List sources used in the analysis.
- Screenshots: Include screenshots of visualizations and code.
